# Event-Monitor-with-CI-CD-Pipeline
This project develops a Python-based AWS Lambda function that monitors security events in your AWS environment, such as changes to S3 access policies and unauthorized EC2 access attempts. By utilizing AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs, the Lambda function sends alerts via Amazon SNS whenever suspicious activity is detected.
